# Curio's Obsidian Resources

Hey- Curio here! This is a repository containing the various [themes](./themes/THEMES.md) and snippets I've written, and [fonts](./fonts/FONTS.md) I've collected for use in my vaults and on my [Publish site](https://publish.obsidian.md/beyond-alex). In an effort to keep track of the licenses for anything not mine, I'm doing my best to keep relevant material together with their license; this is particularly true of my fonts.

Feel free to use anything you find here for your own stuff; my personal things (anything within the `themes` and `snippets` folders) within this repository are available license-free to use in anything you want and/or modify to your heart's content.

If there's anything you'd like for me to extract as a snippet instead, let me know via issue here or on Discord!
