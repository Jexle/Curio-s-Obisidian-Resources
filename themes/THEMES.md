# About the Themes

`Curio-sity` is my personal vault's theme. It's also horribly documented, poorly organized, and I'm genuinely not sure where half the code came from. I'm slowly working on editing and at least _somewhat_ documenting the full code to my tastes, however, and might reorganize (or rewrite) soon after. This is also the theme my animated fonts are in. (The animations need to be condensed, as I have a lot of repeat code right now.)

`Hartwell-Tome` is more organized and better documented right now. It's also a lot smaller, as I'm starting from complete scratch with it and designing it for use with my [writing vault](https://publish.obsidian.md/beyond-alex). This also means it contains a bunch of custom `cssclass`es that I use throughout my vault.
